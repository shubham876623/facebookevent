As a champion of equity and inclusion, New York Cares will livestream our Gala rather than meet in-person. In doing so, all meals that would have been served at the gala will be donated to hundreds of families living in communities hit hardest by the pandemic—including Elmhurst, East New York, and the South Bronx. By supporting the gala, you support New Yorkers across the five boroughs and provide critical access to food.We look forward to our entire community celebrating together virtually on November 9.

0,"New York, My Village: Uwem Akpan with Elif Batuman","The award-winning author’s debut novel explores tribalism everywhere, from Nigerian villages to New York publishing houses. Coming to New York on a prestigious fellowship, Nigerian editor Ekong Udousoro is about to begin the opportunity of a lifetime: to learn the ins and outs of the publishing industry from its epicenter. His colleagues meet him with kindness and hospitality, but he is soon exposed to a colder, ruthlessly commercial underbelly and a bedrock of white cultural superiority and racist assumptions about Africa, its peoples, and worst of all, its food. In New York, My Village Uwem Akpan melds humor, tenderness, and pain to create a saga of unanticipated strife that proves there is still hope in sharing our stories. Uwem Akpan researched and wrote New York, My Village during his 2013–2014 Fellowship at the Library’s Dorothy and Lewis B. Cullman Center for Scholars and Writers. He discusses his book with best-selling author Elif Batuman.REGISTER:https://www.showclix.com/event/akpanbatuman/tag/fbevent The program will be streamed on the NYPL event page.

Other notable feats include the comic figure of Mother Ginger — 85 pounds and nine feet wide, the costume requires handling by three people once it is lowered by pulley over the dancer's head — as well as the continuous flutter of the purest, crystal-shaped snowflakes (which are swept up and conserved after each performance for reuse).","['Dance', 'Online']",26-Nov-21,15:00,NO,No,No,YES,No location given,No website link,No ticket info,https://scontent.fdel11-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-9/p526x296/188020994_446758049758860_3363019550304269081_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=b386c4&_nc_ohc=xc4fjG7qocQAX-EIyBq&_nc_ht=scontent.fdel11-2.fna&oh=b21a49b17bf4c4a70a67830874180cf2&oe=61C06DA6,https://www.facebook.com/events/1103674916784858/

0,"An Evening with Bruce Dickinson | New York, NY","Bruce Dickinson is considered one of the world’s most storied musicians. Aside from decades spent delivering high-octane performances with his larger-than-life persona in IRON MAIDEN, Bruce has lived an extraordinary off-stage existence too.A true polymath, his accomplishments include: pilot and airline captain, aviation entrepreneur, beer brewer, motivational speaker, podcaster, film scriptwriter, twice-published novelist and New York Times Top 10 best-selling author, radio presenter, TV actor, sports commentator and international fencer… to name but a few.So, there’s plenty to be entertained by, throughout the evening’s cornucopia of fascinating tales and derring-do exploits, all delivered by Bruce with characteristically infectious enthusiasm and wry wit.Split into two parts, the first section of the show sees Bruce taking a humorous and often satirical look at the world from his own very personal perspective, treating the audience to private insights into his drive and ambition, peppered with plenty of Maiden anecdotes, and a myriad of other experiences encompassing not just the giddy heights but also the extreme lows, told first-hand in his inimitable anarchic style, punctuated with photographs and sometimes even erupting into song a-capella, to illustrate a point.The final section of the evening is devoted entirely to a Q&A session, with the opportunity to pose questions on any subject whatsoever. As Bruce’s answers will all be completely improvised – the more left-field and quirky the question, the more interesting and compelling the response is likely to be!Don’t miss out on this unique opportunity to spend an up-close and personal evening with one of the world’s most captivating icons in an intimate environment, as Bruce Dickinson brings his Evening With show to the U.S. for the very first time, where you are guaranteed a highly entertaining and enjoyable night out and may even go home inspired to try something new.Tickets are $34.50, $49.50 & $59.50 | $5.50 increase day of showOn Sale Now!Tickets are available online at eTix:https://bit.ly/3nq5qFnAll ages | Reserved SeatingDoors at 6:30 PM | Show at 7:30 PM","['Music', 'Online', 'Concert']",04-Feb-22,19:03,NO,No,No,YES,No location given,No website link,No ticket info,https://scontent.faip1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/p526x296/252916856_225849486306922_2958575268044412694_n.jpg?_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=b386c4&_nc_ohc=eYvBa9Q5PjsAX_37upd&_nc_ht=scontent.faip1-1.fna&oh=d2667dfe150d8cef7e2ae58c5f633332&oe=619FA466,https://www.facebook.com/events/680399039611100/

0,Exploring New York City’s Stair Streets with Michael Cairl | Virtual Program,"For the past three years, our friend Michael Cairl has been recovering from a stroke that impaired his mobility and forced him to get around the city differently. As part of his recovery, Michael has been exploring the city in new ways and documenting it on his blog, On Foot, On Wheels. On foot, he has been climbing the city’s many stair streets, tackling more than 20 of them on his urban walks with friends and family. There are over 100 mapped public streets in the city that are actual staircases, most of them in the hilly sections of Upper Manhattan and the Bronx, (including the one made famous by the 2019 film Joker), but Michael’s also climbed them in Brooklyn and Queens. On this virtual program, Michael will share some of his favorite spots he has discovered, and his passion for making the city more accessible to all. While you can’t navigate these streets on wheels, Michael’s adaptive tricycle built by Adapt Ability allowed him to continue his love of cycling, and all proceeds from this program will support Adapt Ability Bikes.REGISTRATION REQUIRED.

He was tall, tall, -- oh, how tall! and so angular and awkward that I had, for an instant, a feeling of pity for so ungainly a man."" However, once Lincoln warmed up, his face lighted up as with an inward fire; the whole man was transfigured. I forgot his clothes, his personal appearance, and his individual peculiarities. Presently, forgetting myself, I was on my feet like the rest, yelling like a wild Indian, cheering this wonderful man."" -Spectator, Lincoln's Cooper Union Address, February 27, 1860While Abraham Lincoln ascended the political ladder through his home state of Illinois, it was his visits to New York that transformed him from an unknown politician to presidential candidate virtually overnight. But what happened in the Big Apple that would help set the stage for him to become one of, if not the finest, President of the United States? This is the dramatic story of Lincoln in New York and chronicle of one of the greatest political debates in American history.Join New York Adventure Club as we retrace the journey of Abraham Lincoln on his visits to New York through the mid-19th century, ranging from his days as a congressman to heartfelt funeral procession.Led by licensed NYC tour guide and historian John Semlak, our journey through Lincoln's New York visits will include:-An overview of New York before and during the Civil War-A deep dive into Lincoln's NYC itinerary during every visit, from staying at the luxurious Astor House hotel, to hearing famous orator Henry Ward Beecher preach, to his various speaking engagements around the city-New York sites where Abraham and Mary Todd Lincoln visited in their free time, including Mathew Brady's photo studio, Knox's hat shop, and department stores like A.T. Stewart and Lord & Taylor-The profound mourning experienced by New York after news of his assassination , and what the city did to ensure a fitting funeral procession-The location of plaques, statues, and memorials dedicated to Lincoln around ManhattanAfterward, we’ll have a Q&A with John — any and all questions about Lincoln's time spent in New York are welcomed and encouraged!Can't make it live?

Register and get access to the full replay for one week!New York Adventure Club | www.AdventureClub.comFlashback to 1624: The Dutch West India Company dropped off a shipload of people who were to settle on Manhattan Island. But instead of acting as exemplary ambassadors of the Dutch nation, this ribald group of miscreants launched a tradition of excessive drinking, sex, and gambling — not to mention the occasional rebellion that drove leaders like pegleg Peter Stuyvesant into blinding rage. This is the story of these early settlers in pre-New York City territory, and the lascivious culture they carried across the Atlantic — one that would form the backbone of the libertine city we love today.Join New York Adventure Club as we explore New York’s Dutch era between 1624 and 1664, a period that laid the foundation for the pluralistic, freedom-loving society that America would eventually become.Led by Brooklyn author and storyteller Bill Greer, our virtual tour through the scandalous New Amsterdam will include:-An introduction to the many colorful New Amsterdammers , from Nanne Beech — New York's earliest adulteress, to Cornelis van Tienhoven — a bigamist and embezzler-How New Amsterdam Governors like Peter Stuyvesant and Willem Kieft tried to tame this rambunctious lot- An unmasking of famous descendants of the bawdy and rebellious New Amsterdammers, from politicians and tycoons to journalists and fashion designers-A virtual showcase through modern-day lower Manhattan to see the remnants of Manhattan’s original villageAfterward, we'll have a Q&A with Bill — any and all questions about New Amsterdam are welcomed and encouraged!Can't make it live?

That's because on this short stretch of Midtown Manhattan between 6th and Vanderbilt Avenues, there's a wealth of private social clubs tucked away inside some of the city's most stunning buildings. But given New York City's rapid growth since the 19th century, why did 44th Street in particular become the place for many organizations to build their ornate clubhouses? It's time to explore the lasting legacy of 44th Street's Club Row, one secretive community at a time.Join New York Adventure Club as we uncover the ritzy history of Club Row — located on 44th Street between 6th and Vanderbilt Avenues, this short stretch in Midtown Manhattan contains New York's largest collection of private social clubs, most of which still reside in their original grand clubhouses until this very day.Led by writer, historian, and New York City tour guide Lucie Levine, our virtual stroll along New York’s Club Row will include:-An overview of 44th Street in Manhattan , and how (and why) Gilded-Age architects and designers turned a street full of stables into a block of elite clubs-The architectural and social history of some of New York’s most famous and exclusive clubs , including the Harvard Club, Yacht Club, and Yale Club- A discussion of the 44th Street's quirkiest private club , The Coffee House Club, which brought writers, actors, and other creatives to a mostly blue-blooded street-A look at neighborhood plans for a “city within a city” known as Terminal City , and which parts of the plan were (and weren't) realizedAfterward, we’ll have a Q&A with Lucie — any and all questions about the private social clubs of 44th Street are welcomed and encouraged!Can't make it live?

0,Tyson Street to New York Fashion Week: The Style and Influence of Betty Cooke,"Location: VirtualStream live on Facebook: https://bit.ly/3kD1iRLStream live on YouTube: https://youtu.be/rRsy9NwNgrcWhile Betty Cooke is best known for designing and fabricating jewelry, she also played a key role introducing the local Baltimore community to innovative modern design first through her home on Tyson Street and later at The Store Ltd, her shop in the Cross Keys community. The Store Ltd was one of the first shops in America to sell Marimekko fashions, Le Creuset pots, Noguchi paper lamps, and even cardboard furniture designed by Frank Gehry. Join Victoria Pass, faculty member in the Department of Art History, Theory, and Criticism at the Maryland Institute College of Art, in conversation with Shane Prada, Director of the Baltimore Jewelry Center, as they discuss Cooke’s impact on Mid-Century design and Baltimore aesthetics, and her influence on contemporary jewelry. Pass will also discuss the working relationship Cooke had with others such as fashion designer Geoffrey Beene and explore Cooke’s role in the broader context of Mid-Century designers and design intermediaries. This program is part of a series inspired by Cooke and her artistic practice and accompanies the exhibition Betty Cooke: The Circle and the Line, on view at the Walters Art Museum through January 2, 2022. The exhibition is accompanied by a fully illustrated publication, The Circle and the Line: The Jewelry of Betty Cooke, which includes an essay by Jeannine Falino and reflections by a number of friends and collectors. The Circle and the Line: The Jewelry of Betty Cooke is published by the Walters Art Museum in association with D Giles Limited; it is available for purchase at the Walters Museum Store.View this event on our website: https://thewalters.org/event/fashion-week/About the Guest SpeakersVictoria Rose Pass is an Associate Professor at the Maryland Institute College of Art and a specialist in Visual Culture, particularly in areas of design and fashion. Her research considers the history of fashion culture in the 20th century and focuses specifically on issues of gender and race. Her essay ""Racial Masquerades in the Magazines: Defining White Femininity Between the Wars"" was recently published in the Journal of Modern Periodical Studies. She has co-edited two books, Design Beyond the Canon with Jenniver Kauffman-Buhler and Christopher Wilson published by Bloomsbury in February 2019, and Women's Magazines in Print and New Media with Noliwe Rooks and Ayana Weekley published by Routledge in 2016.  Her writing has also appeared in Fashion, Style & Popular Culture, Omenka Magazine, Design and Culture, caa.reviews, and BmoreArt.Shane Prada came to Baltimore in 2004 as a Teach For America corps member. After receiving her Master of Arts in Teaching from JHU in 2006 and completing her TFA tenure, she helped start the Green School of Baltimore, one of the first charter schools in Baltimore city. In 2010, Shane began taking evening classes at MICA’s Jewelry Center, then a continuing studies program. She fell in love with art jewelry and metalsmithing and the community fostered by the Jewelry Center. In the fall of 2012, MICA announced that it would discontinue the 22-year old Jewelry Center program in 2014. In the spring of 2013, Shane took the lead of a group of core MICA faculty and students who sought to create a new organization that would continue the legacy of the MICA Jewelry Center. She has held the role of director of the Baltimore Jewelry Center since the organization opened in June 2014. This event is virtual and is available exclusively on our Facebook and YouTube pages.

0,"Millionaire’s Mile, New York, NY","Social status in New York City at the turn of the 20th century was determined by pedigree as well as wealth, and the private residences built on the Upper East Side reflected both. By 1900, the ‘Old Money’ of New York began to settle along the less developed eastern side of Central Park, where numerous mansions would rise. This mansion rush—with families using intimidatingly lavish architecture as a status symbol—marked the beginning of the neighborhood’s elite reputation. The neighborhood featured some of New York’s grandest homes—so grand that the stretch of Fifth Avenue, beginning around 50th Street, became known as “Millionaire’s Row.” Join Royal Oak as we explore some of the more memorable and exclusive blocks of the south section of the Upper East Side Historic District with an online walking tour.Architectural historian Matt Postal will illustrate his talk with images of some of the neighborhood’s most magnificent mansions—some now consulates, private clubs, offices galleries etc. We will look at Beaux-Arts style houses that were commissioned as wedding gifts for Ernesto and Edith Fabbri (daughter of Maria Louise Vanderbilt) and the William and Maria Schieffelin (daughter of Margaret Vanderbilt Shepherd), now the Lotos Club. He will examine agroup of distinguished neo-Georgian clubhouses such as the Knickerbocker and Colony Clubs – both designed by the prominent architects Delano & Aldrich — and the Links, where golfers and chief executives have mingled for more than a century.LIVEThursday, October 14 | 4:00 p.m. EDTOnline via Zoom WebinarRENTBetween Friday, October 15 to Sunday, October 17Rent the recorded lecture to watch at your leisureTickets$30 Royal Oak Members; $35 non-members","['Art', 'Online']",14-Oct-21,16:00,17:00,NO,NO,YES,No location,https://www.royal-oak.org/events/fall-2021/millionaires-mile/,No ticket info,https://scontent.fdel11-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/s640x640/242293850_10159784719965168_3853667203499578253_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=b386c4&_nc_ohc=KnXZdo9S-rUAX_gAc1a&_nc_ht=scontent.fdel11-2.fna&oh=faa51c84ebc93ef586618a3f8ef198d6&oe=619FA70B,https://www.facebook.com/events/826286931376708/

Решение - во возвращении к подлинному я. Надёжный контракт с ним возможно установить только на принципах уважения к реальности и честных выводов о ней, какими бы горькими они бы не были. «Банды Нью-Йорка» - история, которая прекрасно иллюстрирует эти принципы.Харизматичнейший главный анти-герой (Дэниэл Дэй-Льюис), является буквальным воплощением этих принципов, кульминацией чего является то, что он сам вырезал себе один глаз, который посмел однажды опустить перед лицом своего противника.Сын этого противника (ди Каприо) пытается подобраться к главному злодею, чтобы отомстить, и параллельно - проходит у главного злодея полный курс уважения к реальности и честности с самим собой.","['Art', 'Online']",20-Nov-21,16:00,19:00,NO,NO,YES,No location,https://apeiron.school/gangs-of-new-york,No ticket info,https://scontent.fdel11-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/p526x296/257359388_415157203441825_2910884902207571832_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=b386c4&_nc_ohc=Wgq8EUjOA4IAX97KqNn&_nc_ht=scontent.fdel11-1.fna&oh=fcb4b3454ca1a456bcf5ef7eb82d91f1&oe=619F82E5,https://www.facebook.com/events/628022435213780/

With Burning Boy, Auster tells the extraordinary story of Stephen Crane, best known as the author of The Red Badge of Courage, who transformed American literature through an avalanche of original short stories, novellas, poems, journalism, and war reportage before his life was cut short by tuberculosis at age twenty-eight. In this special talk, Auster will focus on Crane’s life in and writing in the Village and surrounding areas of NYC, including Washington Square, the Bowery, and more. Auster’s insight into Crane’s astonishing originality, productivity, and rare creative processes are those of a fellow literary master.Paul Auster is the bestselling author of 4 3 2 1, Winter Journal, Sunset Park, Invisible, The Brooklyn Follies, The Book of Illusions, and The New York Trilogy, among many other works. In 2006 he was awarded the Prince of Asturias Prize for Literature. Among his other honors are the Prix Médicis étranger for Leviathan, the Independent Spirit Award for the screenplay of Smoke, and the Premio Napoli for Sunset Park. In 2012 he was the first recipient of the NYC Literary Honors in the category of Fiction. He has also been a finalist for the International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award (The Book of Illusions), the PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction (The Music of Chance), and the Edgar Award (City of Glass). He is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and a Commandeur de l’Ordre des Arts et des Lettres.

0,"New York, My Village: Uwem Akpan with Elif Batuman","The award-winning author’s debut novel explores tribalism everywhere, from Nigerian villages to New York publishing houses. Coming to New York on a prestigious fellowship, Nigerian editor Ekong Udousoro is about to begin the opportunity of a lifetime: to learn the ins and outs of the publishing industry from its epicenter. His colleagues meet him with kindness and hospitality, but he is soon exposed to a colder, ruthlessly commercial underbelly and a bedrock of white cultural superiority and racist assumptions about Africa, its peoples, and worst of all, its food. In New York, My Village Uwem Akpan melds humor, tenderness, and pain to create a saga of unanticipated strife that proves there is still hope in sharing our stories. Uwem Akpan researched and wrote New York, My Village during his 2013–2014 Fellowship at the Library’s Dorothy and Lewis B. Cullman Center for Scholars and Writers. He discusses his book with best-selling author Elif Batuman.REGISTER:https://www.showclix.com/event/akpanbatuman/tag/fbevent The program will be streamed on the NYPL event page.

0,'New Amsterdam: Dutch New York's Land of Debauchery' Webinar,"Can't make it live? Register and get access to the full replay for one week!New York Adventure Club | www.AdventureClub.comFlashback to 1624: The Dutch West India Company dropped off a shipload of people who were to settle on Manhattan Island. But instead of acting as exemplary ambassadors of the Dutch nation, this ribald group of miscreants launched a tradition of excessive drinking, sex, and gambling — not to mention the occasional rebellion that drove leaders like pegleg Peter Stuyvesant into blinding rage. This is the story of these early settlers in pre-New York City territory, and the lascivious culture they carried across the Atlantic — one that would form the backbone of the libertine city we love today.Join New York Adventure Club as we explore New York’s Dutch era between 1624 and 1664, a period that laid the foundation for the pluralistic, freedom-loving society that America would eventually become.Led by Brooklyn author and storyteller Bill Greer, our virtual tour through the scandalous New Amsterdam will include:-An introduction to the many colorful New Amsterdammers , from Nanne Beech — New York's earliest adulteress, to Cornelis van Tienhoven — a bigamist and embezzler-How New Amsterdam Governors like Peter Stuyvesant and Willem Kieft tried to tame this rambunctious lot- An unmasking of famous descendants of the bawdy and rebellious New Amsterdammers, from politicians and tycoons to journalists and fashion designers-A virtual showcase through modern-day lower Manhattan to see the remnants of Manhattan’s original villageAfterward, we'll have a Q&A with Bill — any and all questions about New Amsterdam are welcomed and encouraged!Can't make it live? Don't worry, you'll have access to the full replay for one week !See you there, virtually!*Immediately upon registering, you will receive a separate, automated email containing the link to join this webinar**For the best possible viewing experience, please ensure you're using the latest version of your internet browser — Google Chrome is the most compatible. Exact technical requirements and a webinar user guide will be shared in the automated confirmation email upon registration.***A full replay of the experience will be available to all registered guests for up to a weekAbout BillBill Greer is the author of the nonfiction narrative A Dirty Year: Sex, Suffrage, and Scandal in Gilded Age New York, released in April by Chicago Review Press. His earlier novel, The Mevrouw Who Saved Manhattan, paints a portrait of the city’s founding as New Amsterdam. As an officer and trustee of the New Netherland Institute, he chaired the Institute’s program to establish the New Netherland Research Center with the New York State Library. He has spoken on New York history throughout the Hudson Valley.Testimonials""Learned a lot, well organized and presented.

That's because on this short stretch of Midtown Manhattan between 6th and Vanderbilt Avenues, there's a wealth of private social clubs tucked away inside some of the city's most stunning buildings. But given New York City's rapid growth since the 19th century, why did 44th Street in particular become the place for many organizations to build their ornate clubhouses? It's time to explore the lasting legacy of 44th Street's Club Row, one secretive community at a time.Join New York Adventure Club as we uncover the ritzy history of Club Row — located on 44th Street between 6th and Vanderbilt Avenues, this short stretch in Midtown Manhattan contains New York's largest collection of private social clubs, most of which still reside in their original grand clubhouses until this very day.Led by writer, historian, and New York City tour guide Lucie Levine, our virtual stroll along New York’s Club Row will include:-An overview of 44th Street in Manhattan , and how (and why) Gilded-Age architects and designers turned a street full of stables into a block of elite clubs-The architectural and social history of some of New York’s most famous and exclusive clubs , including the Harvard Club, Yacht Club, and Yale Club- A discussion of the 44th Street's quirkiest private club , The Coffee House Club, which brought writers, actors, and other creatives to a mostly blue-blooded street-A look at neighborhood plans for a “city within a city” known as Terminal City , and which parts of the plan were (and weren't) realizedAfterward, we’ll have a Q&A with Lucie — any and all questions about the private social clubs of 44th Street are welcomed and encouraged!Can't make it live?

0,"An Evening with Bruce Dickinson | New York, NY","Bruce Dickinson is considered one of the world’s most storied musicians. Aside from decades spent delivering high-octane performances with his larger-than-life persona in IRON MAIDEN, Bruce has lived an extraordinary off-stage existence too.A true polymath, his accomplishments include: pilot and airline captain, aviation entrepreneur, beer brewer, motivational speaker, podcaster, film scriptwriter, twice-published novelist and New York Times Top 10 best-selling author, radio presenter, TV actor, sports commentator and international fencer… to name but a few.So, there’s plenty to be entertained by, throughout the evening’s cornucopia of fascinating tales and derring-do exploits, all delivered by Bruce with characteristically infectious enthusiasm and wry wit.Split into two parts, the first section of the show sees Bruce taking a humorous and often satirical look at the world from his own very personal perspective, treating the audience to private insights into his drive and ambition, peppered with plenty of Maiden anecdotes, and a myriad of other experiences encompassing not just the giddy heights but also the extreme lows, told first-hand in his inimitable anarchic style, punctuated with photographs and sometimes even erupting into song a-capella, to illustrate a point.The final section of the evening is devoted entirely to a Q&A session, with the opportunity to pose questions on any subject whatsoever. As Bruce’s answers will all be completely improvised – the more left-field and quirky the question, the more interesting and compelling the response is likely to be!Don’t miss out on this unique opportunity to spend an up-close and personal evening with one of the world’s most captivating icons in an intimate environment, as Bruce Dickinson brings his Evening With show to the U.S. for the very first time, where you are guaranteed a highly entertaining and enjoyable night out and may even go home inspired to try something new.Tickets are $34.50, $49.50 & $59.50 | $5.50 increase day of showOn Sale Now!Tickets are available online at eTix:https://bit.ly/3nq5qFnAll ages | Reserved SeatingDoors at 6:30 PM | Show at 7:30 PM","['Music', 'Online', 'Concert']",04-Feb-22,19:03,NO,No,No,YES,No location given,No website link,No ticket info,https://scontent.faip1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/p526x296/252916856_225849486306922_2958575268044412694_n.jpg?_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=b386c4&_nc_ohc=eYvBa9Q5PjsAX_37upd&_nc_ht=scontent.faip1-1.fna&oh=d2667dfe150d8cef7e2ae58c5f633332&oe=619FA466,https://www.facebook.com/events/680399039611100/

0,Exploring New York City’s Stair Streets with Michael Cairl | Virtual Program,"For the past three years, our friend Michael Cairl has been recovering from a stroke that impaired his mobility and forced him to get around the city differently. As part of his recovery, Michael has been exploring the city in new ways and documenting it on his blog, On Foot, On Wheels. On foot, he has been climbing the city’s many stair streets, tackling more than 20 of them on his urban walks with friends and family. There are over 100 mapped public streets in the city that are actual staircases, most of them in the hilly sections of Upper Manhattan and the Bronx, (including the one made famous by the 2019 film Joker), but Michael’s also climbed them in Brooklyn and Queens. On this virtual program, Michael will share some of his favorite spots he has discovered, and his passion for making the city more accessible to all. While you can’t navigate these streets on wheels, Michael’s adaptive tricycle built by Adapt Ability allowed him to continue his love of cycling, and all proceeds from this program will support Adapt Ability Bikes.REGISTRATION REQUIRED.

Register and get access to the full replay for one week!New York Adventure Club | www.AdventureClub.com""When Lincoln rose to speak, I was greatly disappointed. He was tall, tall, -- oh, how tall! and so angular and awkward that I had, for an instant, a feeling of pity for so ungainly a man."" However, once Lincoln warmed up, his face lighted up as with an inward fire; the whole man was transfigured. I forgot his clothes, his personal appearance, and his individual peculiarities. Presently, forgetting myself, I was on my feet like the rest, yelling like a wild Indian, cheering this wonderful man."" -Spectator, Lincoln's Cooper Union Address, February 27, 1860While Abraham Lincoln ascended the political ladder through his home state of Illinois, it was his visits to New York that transformed him from an unknown politician to presidential candidate virtually overnight. But what happened in the Big Apple that would help set the stage for him to become one of, if not the finest, President of the United States? This is the dramatic story of Lincoln in New York and chronicle of one of the greatest political debates in American history.Join New York Adventure Club as we retrace the journey of Abraham Lincoln on his visits to New York through the mid-19th century, ranging from his days as a congressman to heartfelt funeral procession.Led by licensed NYC tour guide and historian John Semlak, our journey through Lincoln's New York visits will include:-An overview of New York before and during the Civil War-A deep dive into Lincoln's NYC itinerary during every visit, from staying at the luxurious Astor House hotel, to hearing famous orator Henry Ward Beecher preach, to his various speaking engagements around the city-New York sites where Abraham and Mary Todd Lincoln visited in their free time, including Mathew Brady's photo studio, Knox's hat shop, and department stores like A.T. Stewart and Lord & Taylor-The profound mourning experienced by New York after news of his assassination , and what the city did to ensure a fitting funeral procession-The location of plaques, statues, and memorials dedicated to Lincoln around ManhattanAfterward, we’ll have a Q&A with John — any and all questions about Lincoln's time spent in New York are welcomed and encouraged!Can't make it live?

0,Tyson Street to New York Fashion Week: The Style and Influence of Betty Cooke,"Location: VirtualStream live on Facebook: https://bit.ly/3kD1iRLStream live on YouTube: https://youtu.be/rRsy9NwNgrcWhile Betty Cooke is best known for designing and fabricating jewelry, she also played a key role introducing the local Baltimore community to innovative modern design first through her home on Tyson Street and later at The Store Ltd, her shop in the Cross Keys community. The Store Ltd was one of the first shops in America to sell Marimekko fashions, Le Creuset pots, Noguchi paper lamps, and even cardboard furniture designed by Frank Gehry. Join Victoria Pass, faculty member in the Department of Art History, Theory, and Criticism at the Maryland Institute College of Art, in conversation with Shane Prada, Director of the Baltimore Jewelry Center, as they discuss Cooke’s impact on Mid-Century design and Baltimore aesthetics, and her influence on contemporary jewelry. Pass will also discuss the working relationship Cooke had with others such as fashion designer Geoffrey Beene and explore Cooke’s role in the broader context of Mid-Century designers and design intermediaries. This program is part of a series inspired by Cooke and her artistic practice and accompanies the exhibition Betty Cooke: The Circle and the Line, on view at the Walters Art Museum through January 2, 2022. The exhibition is accompanied by a fully illustrated publication, The Circle and the Line: The Jewelry of Betty Cooke, which includes an essay by Jeannine Falino and reflections by a number of friends and collectors. The Circle and the Line: The Jewelry of Betty Cooke is published by the Walters Art Museum in association with D Giles Limited; it is available for purchase at the Walters Museum Store.View this event on our website: https://thewalters.org/event/fashion-week/About the Guest SpeakersVictoria Rose Pass is an Associate Professor at the Maryland Institute College of Art and a specialist in Visual Culture, particularly in areas of design and fashion. Her research considers the history of fashion culture in the 20th century and focuses specifically on issues of gender and race. Her essay ""Racial Masquerades in the Magazines: Defining White Femininity Between the Wars"" was recently published in the Journal of Modern Periodical Studies. She has co-edited two books, Design Beyond the Canon with Jenniver Kauffman-Buhler and Christopher Wilson published by Bloomsbury in February 2019, and Women's Magazines in Print and New Media with Noliwe Rooks and Ayana Weekley published by Routledge in 2016.  Her writing has also appeared in Fashion, Style & Popular Culture, Omenka Magazine, Design and Culture, caa.reviews, and BmoreArt.Shane Prada came to Baltimore in 2004 as a Teach For America corps member. After receiving her Master of Arts in Teaching from JHU in 2006 and completing her TFA tenure, she helped start the Green School of Baltimore, one of the first charter schools in Baltimore city. In 2010, Shane began taking evening classes at MICA’s Jewelry Center, then a continuing studies program. She fell in love with art jewelry and metalsmithing and the community fostered by the Jewelry Center. In the fall of 2012, MICA announced that it would discontinue the 22-year old Jewelry Center program in 2014. In the spring of 2013, Shane took the lead of a group of core MICA faculty and students who sought to create a new organization that would continue the legacy of the MICA Jewelry Center. She has held the role of director of the Baltimore Jewelry Center since the organization opened in June 2014. This event is virtual and is available exclusively on our Facebook and YouTube pages.

0,"Millionaire’s Mile, New York, NY","Social status in New York City at the turn of the 20th century was determined by pedigree as well as wealth, and the private residences built on the Upper East Side reflected both. By 1900, the ‘Old Money’ of New York began to settle along the less developed eastern side of Central Park, where numerous mansions would rise. This mansion rush—with families using intimidatingly lavish architecture as a status symbol—marked the beginning of the neighborhood’s elite reputation. The neighborhood featured some of New York’s grandest homes—so grand that the stretch of Fifth Avenue, beginning around 50th Street, became known as “Millionaire’s Row.” Join Royal Oak as we explore some of the more memorable and exclusive blocks of the south section of the Upper East Side Historic District with an online walking tour.Architectural historian Matt Postal will illustrate his talk with images of some of the neighborhood’s most magnificent mansions—some now consulates, private clubs, offices galleries etc. We will look at Beaux-Arts style houses that were commissioned as wedding gifts for Ernesto and Edith Fabbri (daughter of Maria Louise Vanderbilt) and the William and Maria Schieffelin (daughter of Margaret Vanderbilt Shepherd), now the Lotos Club. He will examine agroup of distinguished neo-Georgian clubhouses such as the Knickerbocker and Colony Clubs – both designed by the prominent architects Delano & Aldrich — and the Links, where golfers and chief executives have mingled for more than a century.LIVEThursday, October 14 | 4:00 p.m. EDTOnline via Zoom WebinarRENTBetween Friday, October 15 to Sunday, October 17Rent the recorded lecture to watch at your leisureTickets$30 Royal Oak Members; $35 non-members","['Art', 'Online']",14-Oct-21,16:00,17:00,NO,NO,YES,No location,https://www.royal-oak.org/events/fall-2021/millionaires-mile/,No ticket info,https://scontent.fdel11-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/s640x640/242293850_10159784719965168_3853667203499578253_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=b386c4&_nc_ohc=KnXZdo9S-rUAX_gAc1a&_nc_ht=scontent.fdel11-2.fna&oh=faa51c84ebc93ef586618a3f8ef198d6&oe=619FA70B,https://www.facebook.com/events/826286931376708/

0,Киносеминар: Банды Нью-Йорка (Gangs of New York),"Тема внутренней честности, честности с самими собой - это тема возвращения к подлинному я:https://apeiron.school/gangs-of-new-yorkМы не просто - общество невротиков, глубоко невротична наша культура, как таковая.Невроз - есть бегство от базальной тревоги, когда мир огромен и страшен, населён теми, кто тревогу системно усиливает, и нужно бежать:- к людям (угодничество),- от людей (избегание),- против людей (агрессия).Таковы три базовых решения подсознания в ответ на тяжелый невроз восприятия.В случае с нашей культурой, т.е. коллективным бессознательным, эти три пути становятся: конформизмом (безсубъектностью), обесцениванием, идеологическим сектантством.Бегство от невыносимой реальности в область воображаемых конструктов становится национальной идеей. Решение - во возвращении к подлинному я. Надёжный контракт с ним возможно установить только на принципах уважения к реальности и честных выводов о ней, какими бы горькими они бы не были. «Банды Нью-Йорка» - история, которая прекрасно иллюстрирует эти принципы.Харизматичнейший главный анти-герой (Дэниэл Дэй-Льюис), является буквальным воплощением этих принципов, кульминацией чего является то, что он сам вырезал себе один глаз, который посмел однажды опустить перед лицом своего противника.Сын этого противника (ди Каприо) пытается подобраться к главному злодею, чтобы отомстить, и параллельно - проходит у главного злодея полный курс уважения к реальности и честности с самим собой.","['Art', 'Online']",20-Nov-21,16:00,19:00,NO,NO,YES,No location,https://apeiron.school/gangs-of-new-york,No ticket info,https://scontent.fdel11-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/p526x296/257359388_415157203441825_2910884902207571832_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=b386c4&_nc_ohc=Wgq8EUjOA4IAX97KqNn&_nc_ht=scontent.fdel11-1.fna&oh=fcb4b3454ca1a456bcf5ef7eb82d91f1&oe=619F82E5,https://www.facebook.com/events/628022435213780/

That's because on this short stretch of Midtown Manhattan between 6th and Vanderbilt Avenues, there's a wealth of private social clubs tucked away inside some of the city's most stunning buildings. But given New York City's rapid growth since the 19th century, why did 44th Street in particular become the place for many organizations to build their ornate clubhouses?

There will be time for Q&A following the presentation. Teresa Vega has a Bachelor’s Degrees in Anthropology and Asian Studies from Bowdoin College and previously worked as an adjunct professor in Cultural Anthropology while attending CUNY Graduate School and University Center’s doctoral program in Anthropology.

In 2006 he was awarded the Prince of Asturias Prize for Literature.

0,New York Women Who Shaped The Art World,"Learn how two wealthy women artists used their influence to help establish modern art in early 20th century New York CityCan't make the live event?  No problem!  You can watch the video recording at your convenience for 2 weeks.While we take New York City's first-rate art scene for granted these days, it could have easily never existed. Had it not been for a handful of women who decided to rebel against traditional lives in the domestic sphere, NYC may not have become a center for artistic imagination. This is the story of wealthy women artists from the early 20th century who devoted their time, money, and talent to making New York one of the premier locations of fine art in the world.We highlight the journeys of two powerful women who defied the strictures set for elite women—Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney and Florine Stettheimer. Each sparked an intellectual Salon of artists, writers, and other cultural tastemakers. Both were artists who used their money for good while contributing to the creation  of New York as a global art center.In this image-rich talk, we will learn about:- The art of these two often-overlooked women-The role of women as art salon hosts, and what exactly happened at these ground-breaking events-How Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney helped develop a distinctive Urban Realist American voice and created an art institution-Florine Stettheimer and her innovative sisters attracting artists like Marcel Duchamp to New York, bringing European art innovation stateside, and together erasing gender norms-How the New York City art world owes a debt to rule-defying womenAnd so much more…Join us for this compelling look at how Whitney and Stettheimer flipped convention to change the art world and New York City.Speaker BioRena Tobey’s greatest passion is making art accessible, invigorating, insightful, and fun. She has taught art history at NYU's School for Professional Studies and Southern Connecticut State University. Rena provides talks for many community organizations and conducts lively, interactive tours of museum collections, now online. Just for fun, she has created Artventures!® Game--a cheeky party game on the adventures of art and art history.FAQsWhen will the Zoom invite come?The Zoom invite will be in the CONFIRMATION EMAIL from your order—IF YOU DO NOT RECEIVE IT IN YOUR CONFIRMATION EMAIL PLEASE MESSAGE US IMMEDIATELY.

0,Elodie Lauten's The Death of Don Juan - Complete May 2011 New York Premiere,"This performance is the May 2011 New York Premiere of the late Elodie Lauten's The Death of Don Juan, presented at Theater for a New City. SynopsisThe Death of Don Juan is about the myth rather than the story of Don Juan. In this work, he is an archetype, a symbol of human desire for freedom and transcendence. The setting is a screen reflecting Don Juan's terminal experience as it unfolds in real time, as an apocalyptic replay of his past life as it comes back to him. Death appears to him in a vision in the form of a woman who speaks in tongues and whose multiples voices are those of the women he seduced. This confrontation with the female entity is a role reversal for Don Juan. The power is held by the opposite sex this time around. But he is at once seduced by the Death as a Woman and therefore unable to win his ultimate battle. Instead he begins to realize how barren he has made his life. His mind struggles with self-destruction and insanity. Only then is he able to understand the need for love, compassion, purity and sincerity, all of which he once found trivial. This awakening is his salvation. There is no hell for this Don Juan: he is able to forgive himself and be forgiven.Read her biographical summary at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elodie_Lauten, the New York Times obituary for her at https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/11/arts/music/elodie-lauten-who-wove-opera-from-allen-ginsbergs-poetry-dies-at-63.html and Kyle Gann's appreciation of her music at https://www.artsjournal.com/postclassic/2014/06/one-of-the-greats-elodie-lauten-1950-2014.html.","['Music', 'Online']",18-Nov-21,19:00,NO,No,No,YES,No location,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F68rvf1tqA,No ticket info,https://scontent.fdel11-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/p235x350/251050428_1281974732284924_1619050084949824520_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=b386c4&_nc_ohc=SlFEC5EKAMwAX_4D_J4&_nc_ht=scontent.fdel11-2.fna&oh=87128f1e9ba5447009b4ccf1f5bc2a2e&oe=619EC1B9,https://www.facebook.com/events/886543318901264/

0,New York’s Contemporary Art Tour-Traditional Modalities & Cutting-Edge Technology,"Join us for the second installation of our Virtual Art Gallery Tour series as we continue a celebration of American contemporary art with our tour guide Gabriela Vainsencher.  Gabriela will continue to guide us through some of New York City's best contemporary art galleries giving us a closer look at emerging modalities while revisiting cherished work of artists like Claes Oldenburg and Coosje Van Bruggen. Oldenburg and Van Bruggen are best known for their public art installations featuring large replicas of everyday objects. REGISTER HERE: https://bit.ly/2YhMY99We will also look at new and emerging American artists like Katsu a new-media artist with roots in graffiti, known for his work on autonomous art made by drones and Artificial Intelligence. Amy Sillman will take us on a journey of gestural art with a look at pieces from her show ‘Twice Removed’ which proposes the idea of a multiplied subjectivity, being of two minds, forked paths, and having allegiances to both subject and object.  Gabriela will help us delve deeply into the creative processes and messages of these artists.  Our tour will include highlights from the last two seasons in the city's central art neighborhoods: Chelsea and the Lower East Side. Featured work asks the viewer to consider the influences on, significance of and messages conveyed through the artists’ work. Exploring the legacy of pop art and the use of technology in art we will learn about new modalities in the creation of contemporary art. From your view in the front row seat of this spectacular guided tour, Gabriela will discuss and explain topics such as: How contemporary art is evolving today. What has helped shape each artist's approach to art in general and influenced their work?

Register and get access to the full replay for one week!New York Adventure Club | www.AdventureClub.com""[Rockefeller Center] is one of those expressions of architecture that, after...decades, seems so natural it’s hard to comprehend how revolutionary it was.” -Daniel Okrent, AuthorRising from the depths of the Great Depression in the 1930s, Rockefeller Center helped shift the epicenter of New York's business community from the Wall Street area to Midtown Manhattan. But how did New York's first master-planned, integrated commercial district come to be? And how would it eventually become synonymous with things like NBC Studios, ice skating, and the world's most famous Christmas tree? It's time to explore this 22-acre masterpiece of urban planning and design, one which remains one of the most prominent sites in all of New York.Join New York Adventure Club as we embark on a virtual exploration of Rockefeller Center — an Art Deco building complex commissioned by the Rockefeller family in the 1930s that is considered one of the greatest projects of the Great Depression era.Led by NYC Tour Guide Michael Morgenthal, our digital showcase of this legendary complex will include:-Why John D. Rockefeller Jr. got stuck with land in Midtown he could not lease, and how he pivoted to develop the property himself, placing a huge bet on New York in the middle of the Great Depression-How Rockefeller Center became the epicenter of Christmas in New York , from the origin story of the tradition to the official Christmas tree selection, transportation, and decoration process-How NBC came to call 30 Rockefeller Plaza home, along with a list of some of its most popular television shows including the Tonight Show and Saturday Night Live-The stunning artwork inside and out at Rockefeller Center , and the scandal surrounding what was supposed to be the signature piece in the entire complex-The untold connection between the number 27 and all of the early Rockefeller Center buildings- Rockefeller Center in the 21st century and how this 1930s campus has managed to remain vibrant and relevant all these decades laterAfterward, we'll have a Q&A with Mike — any and all questions about Rockefeller Center are welcomed and encouraged!Can't make it live?

Register and get access to the full replay for one week!New York Adventure Club | www.AdventureClub.comFrom 1867-1955, four different elevated railroads (aka ""Els"") traversed Manhattan, which provided the first true rapid transit to a city choked by traffic. From Civic Center to Chinatown, and Little Italy to the Lower East Side, this is the story of the long-departed transit routes that defined 19th-century NYC, and the hidden remnants that are still standing over 100 years later.Join New York Adventure Club on a fascinating exploration of the former elevated railroads between Brooklyn and Manhattan, from the downtown portions of the 2nd Avenue and 3rd Avenue Elevated Railroads, to the trains that ran across the Brooklyn Bridge.Led by NYC Tour Guide Michael Morgenthal, our virtual experience surrounding the Els of the past will include:- How the Els came to be, and how they radically transformed neighborhoods such as the Civic Center, Chinatown, Little Italy, and the Lower East Side- The story of Allen Street, which was widened in the 1930s in part to alleviate the dirt, noise, and shadows caused by the elevated trains- A closer look at the trains that ran across the Brooklyn Bridge, and how they influenced the design of the Municipal Building near City Hall- The great transfer points including the City Hall Elevated spur and Chatham Square, the latter of which caused chaos and confusion for those looking to transfer between these two lines — for a fee!- Where to find the ghosts of the Elevated, including a Manhattan power station hiding in plain sightAfterward, we'll have a Q&A with Mike — any and all questions about the Elevated railroads are welcomed and encouraged!Can't make it live?

Considering the role of extra-human agency in a range of ecocritical texts on New York since 1890, Paul’s lecture will track Lethem’s tiger to identify the risk of naturalizing politically produced conditions by appealing to a network of human and extra-human actants.About the SpeakerPaul Cockburn is an AHRC funded PhD researcher in the English Studies department at Durham University working in ecocriticism and literary theory. His thesis, ‘Concrete Jungle: Imagining Nature in the Literature of New York City’, looks to ask what we talk about when we talk about urban nature. He lived and studied in New York City for a year but is now back home in Liverpool. He loves cities and cats.Photo credit: Ville Saalo, Feral Pigeon, via Chipper Birds .

0,New York State Cannabis Supply Chain Webinar,"https://business.tompkinschamber.org/events/details/l-e-a-r-n-new-york-state-cannabis-supply-chain-webinar-191411In collaboration with the New York Cannabis Growers and Processors Association (NYCGPA), Downtown Ithaca Alliance, Conventions and Visitors Bureau and City of Ithaca; the Tompkins Chamber is proud to host a panel discussion on the New York State Cannabis Supply Chain featuring Damian Fagon, founder and owner of Gullybean; Karli Miller-Hornick, founder and owner of Head & Heal; Cadmo Matos Jr., owner of Bodega Ink; Brittany Carbone, Founder and CEO of Tonic and Trever Sherman, owner of Ithaca Organics.Legal cannabis presents a unique set of challenges for NYS businesses. All of the legal cannabis sold in NYS will need to be grown here, processed and manufactured here, distributed and sold here; so understanding the supply chain will help position your business for success in this new industry.Come prepared to learn from experienced cannabis business owners, and bring your questions for the panelists. Damian Fagon: Damian is a 3rd-generation farmer with a background in international development and agriculture. He has led development initiatives with castor farmers in Jamaica, rice growers in Sierra Leone and coffee exporters in Guatemala. Since 2017, he has launched and advised commercial cannabis operations in South Carolina, New York and the Caribbean.  Karli Miller-Hornick is the co-owner, co-founder, and CEO of Head & Heal, a CBD producer and regenerative and organic hemp cultivator in Cortland, New York. Her company started producing hemp and CBD in 2017, including high potency CBD tinctures, but she’s been an organic vegetable farmer since 2010. She grows over a hundred varieties of organic vegetables, including carrots for the fast casual salad provider Sweetgreen in New York City. Head & Heal sells produce at farmer’s markets and through their 400-member Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) program, a symbiotic relationship between the farmer and the community.  Cadmo Matos Jr.: From the Bronx to Chicago, down to Florida and even internationally, Cadmo Matos Jr., who goes by Cad, has dipped his toes into many business ventures seeking different avenues of how to reach his goals. Having gone to school for Culinary and Business Administration, Cad worked his way from being a dishwasher at 13 years old to eventually owning his own hookah bar and a hospitality consulting company. Through his consulting career, he quickly noticed the need for more accessible design and marketing needs across various industries and eventually started teaching himself necessary skills to help various businesses and companies build better brands. Once the branding aspect of the company started expanding beyond the others, Cad along with his partners, pivoted and started Bodega Ink, a full in house print and branding company to supply better branding and printing solutions. All having a passion for the Cannabis plant and hospitality as a whole, Cad and his partners focused on becoming an ancillary business and getting others the help they needed to make their businesses flourish.  Brittany Carbone, Founder and CEO of Tonic. Brittany founded TONIC in 2017, while working as a personal trainer and health coach on Long Island, NY. Bootstrapping as a solopreneur, Carbone grew the company from a side-hustle operating out of her parents’ kitchen to the 7-figure business it is today, all while staying true to her original vision and mission of bringing the most healing to the most people. Trever Sherman: Trever is a third-generation farmer in Tompkins County. His farm, Ithaca Organics, is a fruit and vegetable CSA established in 1997. He has been a New York State Hemp Research partner for the last several years.

Join us for a day of online discussions, reflections and meditations. Using the power of the intuitive imagination, we will shine a light on the path towards right relationships with all life.Sociology literally means “the study of companionship” and we might consider that through a focus on Social Regeneration, we will be evoking the Spirit of Companionship, imaginatively seeing it pouring through the entire field of human relationships, bringing fresh meaning, purpose, and a sense of future possibilities.During these difficult pandemic times the need to re-imagine social relations in ways that enhance goodwill, sharing and the sense of belonging has become even more urgent. This is the time to call forth the imagination and consider the regeneration and reigniting of a spirit of companionship between peoples, communities and nations; and between humanity and the living earth.The Seminar in New York is one of three broadcasts occurring on this day.

0,Birds of New York: Audubon in the City,"Birders and scientists discuss the lives of birds in our urban environment and their efforts to make birdwatching more inclusive.More than 200 different species of birds frequent the New York City area. Their safety and survival depend on what we do to curb the impacts of climate change, light pollution, and urbanization. Meanwhile, birding circles are addressing the racist and colonial legacies of the field. How do a diverse set of groups combine their knowledge in birding and ornithology with their passion for social justice to educate the public not only on the issues affecting birds but on those impacting their greatest advocates? Christian Cooper, author of the forthcoming book Better Living Through Birding, moderates a conversation with experts and organizers on how they're building awareness about birds, while strengthening the communities that protect them.This event is produced in partnership with NYC Audubon.Presented as part of The Polonsky Exhibition of The New York Public Library's Treasures, which showcases some of the most extraordinary items from the 56 million in our collections. Among them is John James Audubon's monumental illustrated book Birds of America (1826).

0,"Daniel Soyer – New York Jews in the Immigrant City, 1880-1924","Between the 1870s and the 1920s, almost 2,500,000 Jewish immigrants arrived in the United States with most of them settling in New York City. While New York shaped the contours of Jewish life both in the city and in the rest of the country, Jews also profoundly influenced the culture, politics, and economics of the city and beyond. In this talk, Daniel Soyer examines Jewish immigrant life by looking at the city’s immigrant Jewish neighborhoods, communal organizations, politics, cultural expressions, economic activities, and relations with other segments of the population.Daniel Soyer, professor of History at Fordham University, is especially interested in American Jewish life in New York. Two of his books developed out of this interest, and he has won both the National Jewish Book Award and the American Jewish Historical Society’s Sau Viener Award. In addition, he is coeditor of the journal American Jewish History. Daniel Soyer last spoke to our society in 2014 on Landsmanshaftn.JGSGB members: Program is free.

Eppure sento che dentro questo quadro di luci e movimento non riesco più a trovare la mia dimensione. In realtà non so neanche bene quale sia stato il momento esatto in cui ho smesso di provare fiducia in New York, e in me stesso. Ma questa città è così: quando inizi a credere che tutto scorra senza motivo, lei ti sorprende e ti spiazza ancora una volta."" Il protagonista di questa storia ha perso quell'indefinitezza ed entusiasmo adolescenziale, quella voglia di vivere senza la quale anche New York diventa una città noiosa. Eppure ogni notte, affacciandosi alle finestre del grattacielo dove vive, il fascino di New York lo conquista, come se, con i suoi rumori solitari, cercasse di scacciare quei dubbi per trattenerlo a sé. La sirena dell'ambulanza, un taxi, uno strillo dal nulla, e poi pompieri, camion della spazzatura, clacson, una manifestazione. Una meravigliosa democrazia americana che si realizza di notte, quando inizia una danza infinita di incontri casuali, che sono l'essenza di questa città magica. Ma poi arriva la mattina, ti alzi e pensi: ""In che razza di posto sono finito?"". Solo un incontro inaspettato, un sentimento che mette tutto in discussione, insomma una ragazza speciale, può aiutarlo a darsi una risposta, a guardarsi dentro: scegliere l'amore, una famiglia o continuare a vivere in quello sfavillante luna-park di vetro, strade, neon, ristoranti e club che è New York? Piero Armenti, in questo romanzo profondo ed emotivo, racconta un lato diverso e inedito di New York: le ombre che la costellano sotto le luci scintillanti dei grattacieli, dei silenzi assordanti in mezzo alla folla rumorosa, degli amori impossibili che uniscono le tante solitudini che la popolano.Piero Armenti è un giornalista e urban explorer. Dopo aver concluso il suo dottorato all'Università Orientale di Napoli ha deciso di partire per New York ed è stato amore a prima vista. Così ha fondato ""Il mio viaggio a New York"": un tour operator sui generis, ma soprattutto un blog dove ogni giorno racconta a modo suo la città più desiderata del mondo. Tra le sue pubblicazioni: Una notte ho sognato New York (Mondadori, 2020).","['Literature', 'Online']",12-Oct-21,18:03,NO,No,No,YES,No location,https://www.instagram.com/libraccio_negozi/,No ticket info,https://scontent.fdel11-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/s526x296/244671410_1843467649166159_7830091469914157005_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=b386c4&_nc_ohc=IgWGR75ydjMAX95tLcA&_nc_ht=scontent.fdel11-2.fna&oh=c88f1ff53ecba8951897fea4e02cd501&oe=619EB273,https://www.facebook.com/events/2751461491820386/

Register and get access to the full replay for one week!New York Adventure Club | www.AdventureClub.comFrom 1867-1955, four different elevated railroads (aka ""Els"") traversed Manhattan, which provided the first true rapid transit to a city choked by traffic. From Civic Center to Chinatown, and Little Italy to the Lower East Side, this is the story of the long-departed transit routes that defined 19th-century NYC, and the hidden remnants that are still standing over 100 years later.Join New York Adventure Club on a fascinating exploration of the former elevated railroads between Brooklyn and Manhattan, from the downtown portions of the 2nd Avenue and 3rd Avenue Elevated Railroads, to the trains that ran across the Brooklyn Bridge.Led by NYC Tour Guide Michael Morgenthal , our virtual experience surrounding the Els of the past will include:- How the Els came to be , and how they radically transformed neighborhoods such as the Civic Center, Chinatown, Little Italy, and the Lower East Side-The story of Allen Street , which was widened in the 1930s in part to alleviate the dirt, noise, and shadows caused by the elevated trains-A closer look at the trains that ran across the Brooklyn Bridge , and how they influenced the design of the Municipal Building near City Hall-The great transfer points including the City Hall Elevated spur and Chatham Square, the latter of which caused chaos and confusion for those looking to transfer between these two lines — for a fee!- Where to find the ghosts of the Elevated , including a Manhattan power station hiding in plain sightAfterward, we'll have a Q&A with Mike — any and all questions about the Elevated railroads are welcomed and encouraged!Can't make it live?
