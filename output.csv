As a champion of equity and inclusion, New York Cares will livestream our Gala rather than meet in-person. In doing so, all meals that would have been served at the gala will be donated to hundreds of families living in communities hit hardest by the pandemic—including Elmhurst, East New York, and the South Bronx. By supporting the gala, you support New Yorkers across the five boroughs and provide critical access to food.We look forward to our entire community celebrating together virtually on November 9.

0,"New York, My Village: Uwem Akpan with Elif Batuman","The award-winning author’s debut novel explores tribalism everywhere, from Nigerian villages to New York publishing houses. Coming to New York on a prestigious fellowship, Nigerian editor Ekong Udousoro is about to begin the opportunity of a lifetime: to learn the ins and outs of the publishing industry from its epicenter. His colleagues meet him with kindness and hospitality, but he is soon exposed to a colder, ruthlessly commercial underbelly and a bedrock of white cultural superiority and racist assumptions about Africa, its peoples, and worst of all, its food. In New York, My Village Uwem Akpan melds humor, tenderness, and pain to create a saga of unanticipated strife that proves there is still hope in sharing our stories. Uwem Akpan researched and wrote New York, My Village during his 2013–2014 Fellowship at the Library’s Dorothy and Lewis B. Cullman Center for Scholars and Writers. He discusses his book with best-selling author Elif Batuman.REGISTER:https://www.showclix.com/event/akpanbatuman/tag/fbevent The program will be streamed on the NYPL event page.

Other notable feats include the comic figure of Mother Ginger — 85 pounds and nine feet wide, the costume requires handling by three people once it is lowered by pulley over the dancer's head — as well as the continuous flutter of the purest, crystal-shaped snowflakes (which are swept up and conserved after each performance for reuse).","['Dance', 'Online']",26-Nov-21,15:00,NO,No,No,YES,No location given,No website link,No ticket info,https://scontent.fdel11-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-9/p526x296/188020994_446758049758860_3363019550304269081_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=b386c4&_nc_ohc=xc4fjG7qocQAX-EIyBq&_nc_ht=scontent.fdel11-2.fna&oh=b21a49b17bf4c4a70a67830874180cf2&oe=61C06DA6,https://www.facebook.com/events/1103674916784858/

0,"An Evening with Bruce Dickinson | New York, NY","Bruce Dickinson is considered one of the world’s most storied musicians. Aside from decades spent delivering high-octane performances with his larger-than-life persona in IRON MAIDEN, Bruce has lived an extraordinary off-stage existence too.A true polymath, his accomplishments include: pilot and airline captain, aviation entrepreneur, beer brewer, motivational speaker, podcaster, film scriptwriter, twice-published novelist and New York Times Top 10 best-selling author, radio presenter, TV actor, sports commentator and international fencer… to name but a few.So, there’s plenty to be entertained by, throughout the evening’s cornucopia of fascinating tales and derring-do exploits, all delivered by Bruce with characteristically infectious enthusiasm and wry wit.Split into two parts, the first section of the show sees Bruce taking a humorous and often satirical look at the world from his own very personal perspective, treating the audience to private insights into his drive and ambition, peppered with plenty of Maiden anecdotes, and a myriad of other experiences encompassing not just the giddy heights but also the extreme lows, told first-hand in his inimitable anarchic style, punctuated with photographs and sometimes even erupting into song a-capella, to illustrate a point.The final section of the evening is devoted entirely to a Q&A session, with the opportunity to pose questions on any subject whatsoever. As Bruce’s answers will all be completely improvised – the more left-field and quirky the question, the more interesting and compelling the response is likely to be!Don’t miss out on this unique opportunity to spend an up-close and personal evening with one of the world’s most captivating icons in an intimate environment, as Bruce Dickinson brings his Evening With show to the U.S. for the very first time, where you are guaranteed a highly entertaining and enjoyable night out and may even go home inspired to try something new.Tickets are $34.50, $49.50 & $59.50 | $5.50 increase day of showOn Sale Now!Tickets are available online at eTix:https://bit.ly/3nq5qFnAll ages | Reserved SeatingDoors at 6:30 PM | Show at 7:30 PM","['Music', 'Online', 'Concert']",04-Feb-22,19:03,NO,No,No,YES,No location given,No website link,No ticket info,https://scontent.fdel11-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/p526x296/252916856_225849486306922_2958575268044412694_n.jpg?_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=b386c4&_nc_ohc=eYvBa9Q5PjsAX_37upd&_nc_ht=scontent.fdel11-1.fna&oh=6c650696ce6c104a553d30c8be4776ec&oe=619FA466,https://www.facebook.com/events/680399039611100/

0,Exploring New York City’s Stair Streets with Michael Cairl | Virtual Program,"For the past three years, our friend Michael Cairl has been recovering from a stroke that impaired his mobility and forced him to get around the city differently. As part of his recovery, Michael has been exploring the city in new ways and documenting it on his blog, On Foot, On Wheels. On foot, he has been climbing the city’s many stair streets, tackling more than 20 of them on his urban walks with friends and family. There are over 100 mapped public streets in the city that are actual staircases, most of them in the hilly sections of Upper Manhattan and the Bronx, (including the one made famous by the 2019 film Joker), but Michael’s also climbed them in Brooklyn and Queens. On this virtual program, Michael will share some of his favorite spots he has discovered, and his passion for making the city more accessible to all. While you can’t navigate these streets on wheels, Michael’s adaptive tricycle built by Adapt Ability allowed him to continue his love of cycling, and all proceeds from this program will support Adapt Ability Bikes.REGISTRATION REQUIRED.

He was tall, tall, -- oh, how tall! and so angular and awkward that I had, for an instant, a feeling of pity for so ungainly a man."" However, once Lincoln warmed up, his face lighted up as with an inward fire; the whole man was transfigured. I forgot his clothes, his personal appearance, and his individual peculiarities. Presently, forgetting myself, I was on my feet like the rest, yelling like a wild Indian, cheering this wonderful man."" -Spectator, Lincoln's Cooper Union Address, February 27, 1860While Abraham Lincoln ascended the political ladder through his home state of Illinois, it was his visits to New York that transformed him from an unknown politician to presidential candidate virtually overnight. But what happened in the Big Apple that would help set the stage for him to become one of, if not the finest, President of the United States? This is the dramatic story of Lincoln in New York and chronicle of one of the greatest political debates in American history.Join New York Adventure Club as we retrace the journey of Abraham Lincoln on his visits to New York through the mid-19th century, ranging from his days as a congressman to heartfelt funeral procession.Led by licensed NYC tour guide and historian John Semlak, our journey through Lincoln's New York visits will include:-An overview of New York before and during the Civil War-A deep dive into Lincoln's NYC itinerary during every visit, from staying at the luxurious Astor House hotel, to hearing famous orator Henry Ward Beecher preach, to his various speaking engagements around the city-New York sites where Abraham and Mary Todd Lincoln visited in their free time, including Mathew Brady's photo studio, Knox's hat shop, and department stores like A.T. Stewart and Lord & Taylor-The profound mourning experienced by New York after news of his assassination , and what the city did to ensure a fitting funeral procession-The location of plaques, statues, and memorials dedicated to Lincoln around ManhattanAfterward, we’ll have a Q&A with John — any and all questions about Lincoln's time spent in New York are welcomed and encouraged!Can't make it live?

Register and get access to the full replay for one week!New York Adventure Club | www.AdventureClub.comFlashback to 1624: The Dutch West India Company dropped off a shipload of people who were to settle on Manhattan Island. But instead of acting as exemplary ambassadors of the Dutch nation, this ribald group of miscreants launched a tradition of excessive drinking, sex, and gambling — not to mention the occasional rebellion that drove leaders like pegleg Peter Stuyvesant into blinding rage. This is the story of these early settlers in pre-New York City territory, and the lascivious culture they carried across the Atlantic — one that would form the backbone of the libertine city we love today.Join New York Adventure Club as we explore New York’s Dutch era between 1624 and 1664, a period that laid the foundation for the pluralistic, freedom-loving society that America would eventually become.Led by Brooklyn author and storyteller Bill Greer, our virtual tour through the scandalous New Amsterdam will include:-An introduction to the many colorful New Amsterdammers , from Nanne Beech — New York's earliest adulteress, to Cornelis van Tienhoven — a bigamist and embezzler-How New Amsterdam Governors like Peter Stuyvesant and Willem Kieft tried to tame this rambunctious lot- An unmasking of famous descendants of the bawdy and rebellious New Amsterdammers, from politicians and tycoons to journalists and fashion designers-A virtual showcase through modern-day lower Manhattan to see the remnants of Manhattan’s original villageAfterward, we'll have a Q&A with Bill — any and all questions about New Amsterdam are welcomed and encouraged!Can't make it live?

That's because on this short stretch of Midtown Manhattan between 6th and Vanderbilt Avenues, there's a wealth of private social clubs tucked away inside some of the city's most stunning buildings. But given New York City's rapid growth since the 19th century, why did 44th Street in particular become the place for many organizations to build their ornate clubhouses? It's time to explore the lasting legacy of 44th Street's Club Row, one secretive community at a time.Join New York Adventure Club as we uncover the ritzy history of Club Row — located on 44th Street between 6th and Vanderbilt Avenues, this short stretch in Midtown Manhattan contains New York's largest collection of private social clubs, most of which still reside in their original grand clubhouses until this very day.Led by writer, historian, and New York City tour guide Lucie Levine, our virtual stroll along New York’s Club Row will include:-An overview of 44th Street in Manhattan , and how (and why) Gilded-Age architects and designers turned a street full of stables into a block of elite clubs-The architectural and social history of some of New York’s most famous and exclusive clubs , including the Harvard Club, Yacht Club, and Yale Club- A discussion of the 44th Street's quirkiest private club , The Coffee House Club, which brought writers, actors, and other creatives to a mostly blue-blooded street-A look at neighborhood plans for a “city within a city” known as Terminal City , and which parts of the plan were (and weren't) realizedAfterward, we’ll have a Q&A with Lucie — any and all questions about the private social clubs of 44th Street are welcomed and encouraged!Can't make it live?

0,Tyson Street to New York Fashion Week: The Style and Influence of Betty Cooke,"Location: VirtualStream live on Facebook: https://bit.ly/3kD1iRLStream live on YouTube: https://youtu.be/rRsy9NwNgrcWhile Betty Cooke is best known for designing and fabricating jewelry, she also played a key role introducing the local Baltimore community to innovative modern design first through her home on Tyson Street and later at The Store Ltd, her shop in the Cross Keys community. The Store Ltd was one of the first shops in America to sell Marimekko fashions, Le Creuset pots, Noguchi paper lamps, and even cardboard furniture designed by Frank Gehry. Join Victoria Pass, faculty member in the Department of Art History, Theory, and Criticism at the Maryland Institute College of Art, in conversation with Shane Prada, Director of the Baltimore Jewelry Center, as they discuss Cooke’s impact on Mid-Century design and Baltimore aesthetics, and her influence on contemporary jewelry. Pass will also discuss the working relationship Cooke had with others such as fashion designer Geoffrey Beene and explore Cooke’s role in the broader context of Mid-Century designers and design intermediaries. This program is part of a series inspired by Cooke and her artistic practice and accompanies the exhibition Betty Cooke: The Circle and the Line, on view at the Walters Art Museum through January 2, 2022. The exhibition is accompanied by a fully illustrated publication, The Circle and the Line: The Jewelry of Betty Cooke, which includes an essay by Jeannine Falino and reflections by a number of friends and collectors. The Circle and the Line: The Jewelry of Betty Cooke is published by the Walters Art Museum in association with D Giles Limited; it is available for purchase at the Walters Museum Store.View this event on our website: https://thewalters.org/event/fashion-week/About the Guest SpeakersVictoria Rose Pass is an Associate Professor at the Maryland Institute College of Art and a specialist in Visual Culture, particularly in areas of design and fashion. Her research considers the history of fashion culture in the 20th century and focuses specifically on issues of gender and race. Her essay ""Racial Masquerades in the Magazines: Defining White Femininity Between the Wars"" was recently published in the Journal of Modern Periodical Studies. She has co-edited two books, Design Beyond the Canon with Jenniver Kauffman-Buhler and Christopher Wilson published by Bloomsbury in February 2019, and Women's Magazines in Print and New Media with Noliwe Rooks and Ayana Weekley published by Routledge in 2016.  Her writing has also appeared in Fashion, Style & Popular Culture, Omenka Magazine, Design and Culture, caa.reviews, and BmoreArt.Shane Prada came to Baltimore in 2004 as a Teach For America corps member. After receiving her Master of Arts in Teaching from JHU in 2006 and completing her TFA tenure, she helped start the Green School of Baltimore, one of the first charter schools in Baltimore city. In 2010, Shane began taking evening classes at MICA’s Jewelry Center, then a continuing studies program. She fell in love with art jewelry and metalsmithing and the community fostered by the Jewelry Center. In the fall of 2012, MICA announced that it would discontinue the 22-year old Jewelry Center program in 2014. In the spring of 2013, Shane took the lead of a group of core MICA faculty and students who sought to create a new organization that would continue the legacy of the MICA Jewelry Center. She has held the role of director of the Baltimore Jewelry Center since the organization opened in June 2014. This event is virtual and is available exclusively on our Facebook and YouTube pages.

0,"Millionaire’s Mile, New York, NY","Social status in New York City at the turn of the 20th century was determined by pedigree as well as wealth, and the private residences built on the Upper East Side reflected both. By 1900, the ‘Old Money’ of New York began to settle along the less developed eastern side of Central Park, where numerous mansions would rise. This mansion rush—with families using intimidatingly lavish architecture as a status symbol—marked the beginning of the neighborhood’s elite reputation. The neighborhood featured some of New York’s grandest homes—so grand that the stretch of Fifth Avenue, beginning around 50th Street, became known as “Millionaire’s Row.” Join Royal Oak as we explore some of the more memorable and exclusive blocks of the south section of the Upper East Side Historic District with an online walking tour.Architectural historian Matt Postal will illustrate his talk with images of some of the neighborhood’s most magnificent mansions—some now consulates, private clubs, offices galleries etc. We will look at Beaux-Arts style houses that were commissioned as wedding gifts for Ernesto and Edith Fabbri (daughter of Maria Louise Vanderbilt) and the William and Maria Schieffelin (daughter of Margaret Vanderbilt Shepherd), now the Lotos Club. He will examine agroup of distinguished neo-Georgian clubhouses such as the Knickerbocker and Colony Clubs – both designed by the prominent architects Delano & Aldrich — and the Links, where golfers and chief executives have mingled for more than a century.LIVEThursday, October 14 | 4:00 p.m. EDTOnline via Zoom WebinarRENTBetween Friday, October 15 to Sunday, October 17Rent the recorded lecture to watch at your leisureTickets$30 Royal Oak Members; $35 non-members","['Art', 'Online']",14-Oct-21,16:00,17:00,NO,NO,YES,No location,https://www.royal-oak.org/events/fall-2021/millionaires-mile/,No ticket info,https://scontent.fdel11-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/s640x640/242293850_10159784719965168_3853667203499578253_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=b386c4&_nc_ohc=KnXZdo9S-rUAX_gAc1a&_nc_ht=scontent.fdel11-2.fna&oh=faa51c84ebc93ef586618a3f8ef198d6&oe=619FA70B,https://www.facebook.com/events/826286931376708/

0,Киносеминар: Банды Нью-Йорка (Gangs of New York),"Тема внутренней честности, честности с самими собой - это тема возвращения к подлинному я:https://apeiron.school/gangs-of-new-yorkМы не просто - общество невротиков, глубоко невротична наша культура, как таковая.Невроз - есть бегство от базальной тревоги, когда мир огромен и страшен, населён теми, кто тревогу системно усиливает, и нужно бежать:- к людям (угодничество),- от людей (избегание),- против людей (агрессия).Таковы три базовых решения подсознания в ответ на тяжелый невроз восприятия.В случае с нашей культурой, т.е. коллективным бессознательным, эти три пути становятся: конформизмом (безсубъектностью), обесцениванием, идеологическим сектантством.Бегство от невыносимой реальности в область воображаемых конструктов становится национальной идеей. Решение - во возвращении к подлинному я. Надёжный контракт с ним возможно установить только на принципах уважения к реальности и честных выводов о ней, какими бы горькими они бы не были. «Банды Нью-Йорка» - история, которая прекрасно иллюстрирует эти принципы.Харизматичнейший главный анти-герой (Дэниэл Дэй-Льюис), является буквальным воплощением этих принципов, кульминацией чего является то, что он сам вырезал себе один глаз, который посмел однажды опустить перед лицом своего противника.Сын этого противника (ди Каприо) пытается подобраться к главному злодею, чтобы отомстить, и параллельно - проходит у главного злодея полный курс уважения к реальности и честности с самим собой.","['Art', 'Online']",20-Nov-21,16:00,19:00,NO,NO,YES,No location,https://apeiron.school/gangs-of-new-york,No ticket info,https://scontent.fdel11-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/p526x296/257359388_415157203441825_2910884902207571832_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=b386c4&_nc_ohc=Wgq8EUjOA4IAX97KqNn&_nc_ht=scontent.fdel11-1.fna&oh=fcb4b3454ca1a456bcf5ef7eb82d91f1&oe=619F82E5,https://www.facebook.com/events/628022435213780/

With Burning Boy, Auster tells the extraordinary story of Stephen Crane, best known as the author of The Red Badge of Courage, who transformed American literature through an avalanche of original short stories, novellas, poems, journalism, and war reportage before his life was cut short by tuberculosis at age twenty-eight. In this special talk, Auster will focus on Crane’s life in and writing in the Village and surrounding areas of NYC, including Washington Square, the Bowery, and more.

In 2006 he was awarded the Prince of Asturias Prize for Literature.
